    <p>Here is a short overview of my professional career. For more information, get in touch to read my full CV or to speak directly. </p>
    <p>I am currently seeking opportunities in aeronautics to follow my passion for aviation. After graduating with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering, opportunities in aerospace were scarce due to the coronavirus pandemic. As such, I since gained 3+ years experience working as a Mechanical Engineer and Sustainability Engineer in London.</p>

    <h2>Sustainability / Building Physics Engineer — McBains</h2>
    <h3>Outline<h3>
      <ul>
      <p>Provided technical solutions and guidance through thermal simulation, energy efficiency analysis, and sustainability strategies within a multidisciplinary construction consultancy. Introduced parametric simulation approaches to optimise design and improve prediction accuracy using live metering data.<p>
  <ul>

    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Design Energy Strategy Assessment (UK Part L) & Energy Performance Certification (EPC).</li>
      <li>Overheating Risk Assessment (CIBSE TM52 & TM59) & Operational Energy Analysis (CIBSE TM54).<li>
      <li>Decarbonisation Feasibility, Predicted Energy Performance & Parametric Simulation Design Assessment (IESVE).</li>
      <Li>Advise clients on options for reducing energy use, managing overheating and decarbonising on existing building projects.</Li>
      <Li>Provide technical advice and solutions to the design team for achieving sustainability targets on new build projects.</Li>
    </ul>

<h2>Mechanical Design Engineer — Hulley & Kirkwood</h2>
<h3>Outline</h3>
