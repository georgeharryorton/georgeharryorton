<p>Here are a few things that interest me outside of work.</p>

<h3>UAVs &amp; Drones</h3>
<p>I first got into UAVs at university during my final year project dissertation. I colloquially named the aircraft "Pterodactyl", succeeding the "Phoenix" aircraft I made during a group project in my first year. Since then, I have purchsed a small DJI drone and I am currently working towards gaining a UK GVC drone licence. I am also looking to gain some flying experience with lessons in a fixed-wing aircraft and to join a model flying club.</p>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>I have found running to be the overall best way to stay fit and compliment my other hobbies of playing tennis, bouldering and hiking. In 2024 I ran my first half marathon in Budapest. I finished with a time of 2 hours and 9 minutes, agonisingly close to my sub-2-hour goal. In 2026 I will take part in the Vienna Half Marathon!</p>

<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>I have been very lucky to be able to visit some incredible places around the world. In late 2024, I took a sabbatical break to re-evaluate my career path, and to travel through Asia &amp; Australia on a once in a lifetime trip. In 2027 I hope to go on a roadtrip with friends from the Grand Canyon to Yellowstone.</p>

<h3>Charity &amp; Community</h3>
<p>I have raised over £2,300 for Shelter UK and the National Autistic Society. I am looking for more good fundraising opportunities and community programmes. If you have any that you would reccomend, let me know by sending me an email.</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I first learnt how to play electric guitar when I was a teenager and have since learnt acoustic and bass guitar as well. I have featured on studio recordings for friends of mine who are professional musicians. I have been to Glastonbury Music Festival twice, once in 2023 and again in 2025.</p>

<h3>Website</h3>
<p>I recently decided to launch my own website to boost my profile and to learn more software skills. The website is currently in it's first test iteration. As such, I will be making lots of changes and testing new features. Watch this space!</p>
